/// \mainpage Arduino USB Interface to USB joystick/game pad
///
/// This is the USBJoystick 1.0 library.
/// It provides an Arduino library and class for reading input from a 
/// USB joystick/game pad, such as Logitech 'Dual Action' game pad.
/// It can be subclassed to get control when new input values are read, or when they actually change.
/// Alternatively, you can set up callback functions to be called 
/// when new input values are read, or when they actually change.
/// 
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/USBJoystick/USBJoystick-1.0.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/USBJoystick
///
/// \par Prerequisites
///
/// Requires:
/// - SparkFun USB Host Shield
/// - USB_Host_Shield library. Install this in your libraries folder with a command like:
/// \code
/// git clone git://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield.git
/// \endcode
///
/// This library does not steal any timers or add any interrupt handlers.
/// 
/// \par Example programs
///
/// Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// The following example programs are provided:
/// - usbjoystick_test: Simple domonstration that print to Serial when input changes
///
/// \par Installation
///
/// Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries
/// sub-folder of your sketchbook. 
///
/// If you are using the older Sparkfun DEV-09628 USB Host Shield, you will need to alter the 
/// pin definitions in Max3421e_constants.h in the USB_Host_Shield library as discussed in 
/// http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9628
///
/// If you require the USB Host Shield to be installed with WiShield, expect pin conflicts. These can be resolved by 
/// Bending the USB Host Shield pins D8, D9 and D10 out of the way and then jumpering Host Shield D10 to D6,
/// Host Shield D9 to D3, Host Shield D8 to D5, then changing the settings in Max3421e_constants.h like this 
/// (for the older Sparkfun DEV-09628 USB Host Shield). See <a href="IMG_8837.JPG">this photo</a> showing Duemilanove, 
/// WiShield and USB Host Shield stack.
/// \code
/// // For USB Host Shield DEV-09628 interop with WiShield
/// #define MAX_SS      6
/// #define MAX_INT     3
/// #define MAX_GPX     7
/// #define MAX_RESET   5
/// \endcode
///
/// This library has been tested with Duemilanove and SparkFun USB Host Shield DEV-09628, with the 
/// Logitech 'Dual Action' USB Game Pad P/N 863247-0010 compiled with arduino-0021 
/// on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15,

/// \class USBJoystick USBJoystick.h <USBJoystick.h>
/// \brief USB Interface to USB joystick/game pad, such as Logitech 'Dual Action' game pad
///
/// \par Overview
///
/// A class that interfaces with a USB Joystick or game pad. 
/// It can be subclassed to get control when new input values are read, or when they actually change.
/// Alternatively, you can set up callback functions to be called 
/// when new input values are read, or when they actually change.
///
/// Input data such as stick positions, button presses and hat-switch directions are read from the device
/// and delivered to the calling
/// application.
///
/// USBJoystick uses the USB_Host_Shield library to initialise and interrogate a USB joystick or game pad.
/// When the task() function is called, an attempt to read new values from the joystick is made every 
/// USBJOYSTICK_POLL_INTERVAL milliseconds.
/// If successful the NewValue
/// virtual functions are called. These in turn call the ValueDidChange virtual functions if the value 
/// changed since last poll. After the poll the new values can also be read with the data accessor functions.
///
/// The virtual functions will call their respective callbacks if callback functions have been set up.
///
/// Therefore developers have several choices for getting input data from a device:
/// - subclass USBJoystick and override the *NewValue() and/or *ValueDidChange() functions.
/// - set callback functions with set*NewValueCallback() and set*ValueDidChangeCallback() functions
/// - Asynchronously read current values with the *Value() functions.
///
/// \par Input indexes
///
/// The joystick/game pad is considered to have a number of joysticks, buttons and hat switches. In order
/// to identifiy which joysticks, buttons or hat switch is being referred to in callbacks etc, an index number is used.
/// Macros can be used to refer to specific items by name, see the USBJOYSTICK_STICK_*, USBJOYSTICK_BUTTON_* and 
/// USBJOYSTICK_HAT_* macros. The Logitech Dula Action game pad has 4 sticks 
/// (really 2 physical sticks with vertical and horizontal movement), 13 buttons and 1 hat switch.
///
/// \par Input Device Values
///
/// Stick positions are represented as 8 bit unsigned integers:
///   - 0 is fully left or up
///   - 255 is fully right or down
///
/// Button positions are represented by booleans:
///  - true - button is pressed (in the case of MODE button, mode is enabled and the red light is on) 
///  - false - otherwise
///
/// Hat switch positions are represented as 8 bit unsigned integers.
/// The current hat position is one of USBJOYSTICK_HAT_POS_*.
